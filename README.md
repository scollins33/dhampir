This extension allows for pop-up, customizable searches of Monster's resume database.
** You must have a valid Monster.com account to use this extension **

This extension can be used to generate full customization in your Monster.com searches. No matter what webpage you are on, you can instantly fill out a search query for Monster's database. The query will open in a new tab.

Advantages over Monster's regular interface: 
1) No character limit for your Boolean string
2) Custom radius ranges
3) Custom date ranges

I tried to catch all of the bugs before release, but please don't hesitate to submit any suggestions/problems you run into. Remember, I am one (inexperienced) person so I might not be able to fix things right away. 

Currently, Chrome does not support popups remaining open. It would be awesome, but can't be done right now. 

Potential Future Endeavors:
- Add a "Recent Job Title"/"Target Job Title" switch
- Add functionality to save entry text upon reopening the popup
- Add a "Save Search" option for repeated/continued search capability

Explanation of Permissions:

The only permission this extension needs is Tabs. This allows it to create a new tab for you. This is the only feature of the Tabs permission it uses; it does not access your history, etc.

Explanation of Donations:

I put a donations button in case anyone feels like they want to tip me! It's not required, I purposefully wanted the extension to be free. PayPal no longer allows "donations" in a broad sense, so the page it takes you to is a purchase page. Enter the amount and update the cart to throw me some coin! Donating also reduces the chance of shark attacks in the workplace.
